# Pos Exporter

Pos Exporter is a module that facilitates the synchronization of data between Odoo and an external Point of Sale (Pos) system. It provides a framework for exporting records from Odoo to the Pos system.

## Usage

The Pos Exporter module includes several classes and methods that can be extended and customized to meet specific integration requirements. Here is an overview of the key components and their functionalities:

### PosExporter

The `PosExporter` class is the main entry point for exporting records to the Pos system. It provides methods for exporting individual records and their dependencies.

#### Methods

- `_export_record(record)`: Exports a single record to the Pos system.
- `_export_dependencies()`: Exports the dependencies of the current record.
- `_run(fields=None, **kwargs)`: Main synchronization flow implemented in inherited classes.

### Exporters

Exporters are responsible for exporting specific types of records to the Pos system. They extend the `PosExporter` class and implement the necessary methods for mapping data, validating data, creating or updating records in the external system, and handling dependencies.

#### Methods

- `_map_data()`: Converts the Odoo record to the format expected by the Pos system.
- `_validate_data(data)`: Checks if the data to be imported is correct.
- `_create(data)`: Creates a new record in the Pos system.
- `_update(data)`: Updates an existing record in the Pos system.
- `_lock()`: Locks the binding record to prevent concurrent exports of the same record.
- `_export_dependencies()`: Exports the dependencies of the current record.

### Binders

Binders handle the mapping between Odoo records and their corresponding records in the Pos system. They provide methods for creating, updating, and retrieving binding records.

### ConnectorEnvironment

The `ConnectorEnvironment` class represents the current environment (backend, session, etc.) in which the synchronization is performed. It provides access to various resources and services required for the synchronization process.
